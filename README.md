Hey I’m Steve, a Software Engineer with 15+ years experience writing PHP, Ruby & Python. I specialize in building web apps using frameworks like Laravel, Rails, React and Vue.js.

I work remotely with teams to build appropriate, elegant and reliable solutions to complex problems – helping global companies, start-ups and web agencies reach business goals with technology, on-budget, on-time. I'm from the UK and currently in Phu Quoc, Vietnam.

I also [write blog posts](https://steve.ly/blog) and maintain a few [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/stevelacey). If you’re interested in hiring me [check out my resume](https://steve.ly/resume) and [drop me a line](mailto:steve@steve.ly). I am currently looking for remote contracts/roles.
